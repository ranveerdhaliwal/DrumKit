# DrumKit

Based off of the 30 day JS challenge, I used their drum kit repo as the example and rewrote in React just for practice.

Sounds and some of the core code was taken from their repo and I had to fill any gaps between their code and react/typescript. Also I did my own styling just for fun.

Their repo for reference:
